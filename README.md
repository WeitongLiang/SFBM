# Optimal Option Pricing Model Driven by Mixed Sub-Fractional Brownian Motion (SFBM)

This repository contains a research project that develops and evaluates an **option pricing model driven by mixed sub-fractional Brownian motion (SFBM)**. The project was supervised by Dr. Matthias Dörrzapf at the University of Cambridge and conducted remotely between July and November 2022.

##  Overview

Sub-fractional Brownian motion (SFBM) provides a non-stationary, non-semimartingale generalization of classical Brownian motion with long-range dependence. This project introduces a mixed-SFBM-driven model for option pricing, extending the classical Black–Scholes framework to account for memory and non-Markovian features observed in real markets.

### Key Contributions

- Derived the closed-form pricing formula for European call options under mixed SFBM by solving the associated stochastic difference equations.
- Employed the simulated annealing algorithm to optimize model parameters for best pricing accuracy.
- The proposed model improved pricing accuracy by 26% compared to SFBM and 5% over the Black–Scholes model.
